Confirmatory Adaptive Clinical Trial Design, Simulation, and Analysis.

## Functional Range

- Fixed sample design and designs with interim analysis stages
- Sample size and power calculation for
  - means (continuous endpoint)
  - rates (binary endpoint)
  - survival trials with flexible recruitment and survival time options
  - count data
- Simulation tool for means, rates, survival data, and count data
  - Assessment of adaptive sample size/event number recalculations based
    on conditional power
  - Assessment of treatment selection strategies in multi-arm trials
- Adaptive analysis of means, rates, and survival data
- Adaptive designs and analysis for multi-arm trials
- Adaptive analysis and simulation tools for enrichment design testing
  means, rates, and hazard ratios
- Automatic boundary recalculations during the trial for analysis with
  alpha spending approach, including under- and over-running

## Use on corporate computer systems

Please [contact](https://www.rpact.com/contact/) us to learn how to use
`rpact` on FDA/GxP-compliant validated corporate computer systems and
how to get a copy of the formal validation documentation that is
customized and licensed for exclusive use by your company, e.g., to
fulfill regulatory requirements. The validation documentation contains
the personal access data for performing the installation qualification
with `testPackage()`.
