Parameter Description: Standard Deviation for Simulation

## Arguments

- stDev:

  The standard deviation under which the data is simulated, default is
  `1`. For two-armed trials, it is allowed to specify the standard
  deviations separately, i.e., as vector with two elements. If
  `meanRatio = TRUE` is specified, `stDev` defines the coefficient of
  variation `sigma / mu2`.
