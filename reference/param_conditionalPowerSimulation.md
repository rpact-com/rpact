# Parameter Description: Conditional Power

Parameter Description: Conditional Power

## Arguments

- conditionalPower:

  If `conditionalPower` together with `minNumberOfSubjectsPerStage` and
  `maxNumberOfSubjectsPerStage` (or `minNumberOfEventsPerStage` and
  `maxNumberOfEventsPerStage` for survival designs) is specified, a
  sample size recalculation based on the specified conditional power is
  performed. It is defined as the power for the subsequent stage given
  the current data. By default, the conditional power will be calculated
  under the observed effect size. Optionally, you can also specify
  `thetaH1` and `stDevH1` (for simulating means), `pi1H1` and `pi2H1`
  (for simulating rates), or `thetaH1` (for simulating hazard ratios) as
  parameters under which it is calculated and the sample size
  recalculation is performed.
