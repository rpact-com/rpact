Parameter Description: Minimum Number Of Subjects Per Stage

## Arguments

- minNumberOfSubjectsPerStage:

  When performing a data driven sample size recalculation, the numeric
  vector `minNumberOfSubjectsPerStage` with length `kMax` determines the
  minimum number of subjects per stage (i.e., not cumulated), the first
  element is not taken into account. For two treatment arms, it is the
  number of subjects for both treatment arms. For multi-arm designs
  `minNumberOfSubjectsPerStage` refers to the minimum number of subjects
  per selected active arm.
