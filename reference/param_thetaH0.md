# Parameter Description: Theta H0

Parameter Description: Theta H0

## Arguments

- thetaH0:

  The null hypothesis value, default is `0` for the normal and the
  binary case (testing means and rates, respectively), it is `1` for the
  survival case (testing the hazard ratio).  
    
  For non-inferiority designs, `thetaH0` is the non-inferiority bound.
  That is, in case of (one-sided) testing of

  - *means*: a value `!= 0` (or a value `!= 1` for testing the mean
    ratio) can be specified.

  - *rates*: a value `!= 0` (or a value `!= 1` for testing the risk
    ratio `pi1 / pi2`) can be specified.

  - *survival data*: a bound for testing H0:
    `hazard ratio = thetaH0 != 1` can be specified.

  - *count data*: a bound for testing H0:
    `lambda1 / lambda2 = thetaH0 != 1` can be specified.

  For testing a rate in one sample, a value `thetaH0` in (0, 1) has to
  be specified for defining the null hypothesis H0: `pi = thetaH0`.
