# Parameter Description: Show Source

Parameter Description: Show Source

## Arguments

- showSource:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, the parameter names of the object will be printed
  which were used to create the plot; that may be, e.g., useful to check
  the values or to create own plots with the base R `plot` function.
  Alternatively `showSource` can be defined as one of the following
  character values:

  - `"commands"`: returns a character vector with plot commands

  - `"axes"`: returns a list with the axes definitions

  - `"test"`: all plot commands will be validated with `eval(parse())`
    and returned as character vector (function does not stop if an error
    occurs)

  - `"validate"`: all plot commands will be validated with
    `eval(parse())` and returned as character vector (function stops if
    an error occurs)

  Note: no plot object will be returned if `showSource` is a character.
