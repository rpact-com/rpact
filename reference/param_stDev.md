Parameter Description: Standard Deviation

## Arguments

- stDev:

  The standard deviation under which the sample size or power
  calculation is performed, default is `1`. For two-armed trials, it is
  allowed to specify the standard deviations separately, i.e., as vector
  with two elements. If `meanRatio = TRUE` is specified, `stDev` defines
  the coefficient of variation `sigma / mu2`.
