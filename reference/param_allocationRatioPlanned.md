Parameter Description: Allocation Ratio Planned

## Arguments

- allocationRatioPlanned:

  The planned allocation ratio `n1 / n2` for a two treatment groups
  design, default is `1`. For multi-arm designs, it is the allocation
  ratio relating the active arm(s) to the control. For simulating means
  and rates for a two treatment groups design, it can be a vector of
  length `kMax`, the number of stages. It can be a vector of length
  `kMax`, too, for multi-arm and enrichment designs. In these cases, a
  change of allocating subjects to treatment groups over the stages can
  be assessed. Note that internally `allocationRatioPlanned` is treated
  as a vector of length `kMax`, not a scalar.
