Confirmatory Adaptive Clinical Trial Design, Simulation, and Analysis.

## Functional Range

*	Fixed sample design and designs with interim analysis stages
*	Sample size and power calculation for
    +	means (continuous endpoint)
    +	rates (binary endpoint)
    +	survival trials with flexible recruitment and survival time options
    +	count data 
*	Simulation tool for means, rates, survival data, and count data
    +	Assessment of adaptive sample size/event number recalculations based on
        conditional power
    +   Assessment of treatment selection strategies in multi-arm trials
*	Adaptive analysis of means, rates, and survival data
*	Adaptive designs and analysis for multi-arm trials
*	Adaptive analysis and simulation tools for enrichment design testing means,
    rates, and hazard ratios
*	Automatic boundary recalculations during the trial for analysis with alpha
    spending approach, including under- and over-running
