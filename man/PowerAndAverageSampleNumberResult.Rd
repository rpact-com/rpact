\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{nMax}}{The maximum sample size. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a whole number.}

\item{\code{theta}}{A vector of standardized effect sizes (theta values). Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{averageSampleNumber}}{The average sample number calculated for each value of \code{theta} or \code{nMax}, if the specified maximum sample size would be exceeded. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{calculatedPower}}{The calculated power for the given scenario.}

\item{\code{overallEarlyStop}}{The overall early stopping probability. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{earlyStop}}{The probability to stopping the trial either for efficacy or futility. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{overallReject}}{The overall rejection probability. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{rejectPerStage}}{The probability to reject a hypothesis per stage of the trial. Is a numeric matrix.}

\item{\code{overallFutility}}{The overall stopping for futility probability. Is a numeric vector.}
