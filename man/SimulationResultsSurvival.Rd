\item \code{\link{SimulationResultsEnrichmentSurvival}}.
}
}
\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{maxNumberOfIterations}}{The number of simulation iterations. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a whole number.}

\item{\code{seed}}{The seed used for random number generation. Is a numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{allocationRatioPlanned}}{The planned allocation ratio (\code{n1 / n2}) for the groups. For multi-arm designs, it is the allocation ratio relating the active arm(s) to the control. Is a positive numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{conditionalPower}}{The conditional power at each stage of the trial. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a value between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{iterations}}{The number of iterations used for simulations. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a whole number.}

\item{\code{futilityPerStage}}{The per-stage probabilities of stopping the trial for futility. Is a numeric matrix.}

\item{\code{futilityStop}}{In simulation results data set: indicates whether trial is stopped for futility or not.}

\item{\code{directionUpper}}{Specifies the direction of the alternative, only applicable for one-sided testing. Default is \code{TRUE} which means that larger values of the test statistics yield smaller p-values. Is a logical vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{plannedEvents}}{Determines the number of cumulated (overall) events in survival designs when the interim stages are planned. For two treatment arms, is the number of events for both treatment arms. For multi-arm designs, refers to the overall number of events for the selected arms plus control.
