\arguments{
\item{outDir}{The absolute path to the output directory where all test results will be saved.
By default, the current working directory is used.}

\item{...}{Ensures that all arguments (starting from the "...") are to be named and
that a warning will be displayed if unknown arguments are passed.}

\item{completeUnitTestSetEnabled}{If \code{TRUE} (default), all existing unit tests will
be executed; if \code{FALSE}, only a subset of tests is run.}

\item{connection}{A \code{list} allowing owners of the rpact validation documentation
to provide \code{token} and \code{secret} credentials for full access to unit tests,
enabling them to meet regulatory requirements (see \href{https://www.rpact.com}{www.rpact.com} for more information).}

\item{testFileDirectory}{An optional path pointing to a local directory containing test files.}

\item{downloadTestsOnly}{If \code{TRUE}, the unit test files are only downloaded and not executed.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{addWarningDetailsToReport}{If \code{TRUE}, additional warning details are included in the test report.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{reportType}{The type of report to generate.
Can be \code{"compact"}, \code{"detailed"}, or \code{"Rout"}.}

\item{testInstalledBasicPackages}{If \code{TRUE}, tests for installed
basic R packages are included, default is \code{TRUE}.
For more information, see \code{\link[tools]{testInstalledBasic}}.}

\item{scope}{The scope of the basic R package tests to run. Can be \code{"basic"},
\code{"devel"}, \code{"both"}, \code{"internet"}, or \code{"all"}. Default is \code{"basic"}.
For more information, see \code{\link[tools]{testInstalledBasic}}.
Only available if \code{testInstalledBasicPackages = TRUE}.}

\item{openHtmlReport}{If \code{TRUE}, the HTML report is opened after the tests are completed, default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{keepSourceFiles}{If \code{TRUE}, the source files are kept after the tests are completed.
A copy of them can be found in the subdirectory \code{src}.}

\value{
Invisibly returns the value of \code{completeUnitTestSetEnabled}.

\description{
This function ensures the correct installation of the \code{rpact} package by performing
various tests. It supports a comprehensive validation process, essential for GxP compliance
and other regulatory requirements.
}
\details{
This function is integral to the installation qualification (IQ) process of the \code{rpact} package,
ensuring it meets quality standards and functions as expected. A directory named \code{rpact-tests}
is created within the specified output directory, where all test files are downloaded from a secure
resource and executed. Results are saved in the file \code{testthat.Rout}, located in the
\code{rpact-tests} directory.

Installation qualification is a critical step in the validation process. Without successful IQ,
the package cannot be considered fully validated. To gain access to the full set of unit tests,
users must provide \code{token} and \code{secret} credentials, which are distributed to
members of the rpact user group as part of the validation documentation.
For more information, see vignette \href{https://www.rpact.org/vignettes/utilities/rpact_installation_qualification}{rpact_installation_qualification}.
