\title{Get Performance Score}
\usage{
getPerformanceScore(simulationResult)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulationResult}{A simulation result.}
}
\description{
Calculates the conditional performance score, its sub-scores and components according to
Herrmann et al. (2020) for a given simulation result from a two-stage design.
Larger (sub-)score and component values refer to a better performance.
}
\details{
The conditional performance score consists of two sub-scores, one for the sample size
(subscoreSampleSize) and one for the conditional power (subscoreConditionalPower).
Each of those are composed of a location (locationSampleSize, locationConditionalPower)
and variation component (variationSampleSize, variationConditionalPower).
The term conditional refers to an evaluation perspective where the interim results
suggest a trial continuation with a second stage.
The score can take values between 0 and 1. More details on the performance score
can be found in Herrmann et al. (2020).
