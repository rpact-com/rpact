\title{Parameter Description: Allocation Ratio Planned}
\arguments{
\item{allocationRatioPlanned}{The planned allocation ratio \code{n1 / n2} for a two treatment groups
design, default is \code{1}. For multi-arm designs, it is the allocation ratio relating the active arm(s) to the control.
For simulating means and rates for a two treatment groups design, it can be a vector of length kMax, the number of stages.
In this case, a change of allocating subjects to treatment groups over the stages can be assessed.}
