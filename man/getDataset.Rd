\usage{
getDataset(..., floatingPointNumbersEnabled = FALSE)

getDataSet(..., floatingPointNumbersEnabled = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{A \code{data.frame} or some data vectors defining the dataset.}

\item{floatingPointNumbersEnabled}{If \code{TRUE},
sample sizes and event numbers can be specified as floating-point numbers
(this make sense, e.g., for theoretical comparisons); \cr
by default \code{floatingPointNumbersEnabled = FALSE}, i.e.,
samples sizes and event numbers defined as floating-point numbers will be truncated.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{\link{Dataset}} object.
The following generics (R generic functions) are available for this result object:
\itemize{
  \item \code{\link[=names.FieldSet]{names}} to obtain the field names,
  \item \code{\link[=print.FieldSet]{print}} to print the object,
  \item \code{\link[=summary.ParameterSet]{summary}} to display a summary of the object,
  \item \code{\link[=plot.Dataset]{plot}} to plot the object,
  \item \code{\link[=as.data.frame.ParameterSet]{as.data.frame}} to coerce the object to a \code{\link[base]{data.frame}},
  \item \code{\link[=as.matrix.FieldSet]{as.matrix}} to coerce the object to a \code{\link[base]{matrix}}.
}
}
\description{
Creates a dataset object and returns it.
}
\details{
The different dataset types \code{DatasetMeans}, of \code{DatasetRates}, or
\code{DatasetSurvival} can be created as follows:
\itemize{
  \item An element of \code{\link{DatasetMeans}} for one sample is created by \cr
    \code{getDataset(sampleSizes =, means =, stDevs =)} where \cr
    \code{sampleSizes}, \code{means}, \code{stDevs} are vectors with stage-wise sample sizes,
    means and standard deviations of length given by the number of available stages.
  \item An element of \code{\link{DatasetMeans}} for two samples is created by \cr
    \code{getDataset(sampleSizes1 =, sampleSizes2 =, means1 =, means2 =, } \cr
    \code{stDevs1 =, stDevs2 =)} where
    \code{sampleSizes1}, \code{sampleSizes2}, \code{means1}, \code{means2},
    \code{stDevs1}, \code{stDevs2} are vectors with
    stage-wise sample sizes, means and standard deviations for the two treatment groups
    of length given by the number of available stages.
  \item An element of \code{\link{DatasetRates}} for one sample is created by \cr
    \code{getDataset(sampleSizes =, events =)} where \code{sampleSizes}, \code{events} are vectors
    with stage-wise sample sizes and events of length given by the number of available stages.
  \item An element of \code{\link{DatasetRates}} for two samples is created by \cr
    \code{getDataset(sampleSizes1 =, sampleSizes2 =, events1 =, events2 =)} where
    \code{sampleSizes1}, \code{sampleSizes2}, \code{events1}, \code{events2}
    are vectors with stage-wise sample sizes
    and events  for the two treatment groups of length given by the number of available stages.
  \item An element of \code{\link{DatasetSurvival}} is created by \cr
    \code{getDataset(events =, logRanks =, allocationRatios =)} where
    \code{events}, \code{logRanks}, and \code{allocation ratios} are the stage-wise events,
    (one-sided) logrank statistics, and allocation ratios.
  \item An element of \code{\link{DatasetMeans}}, \code{\link{DatasetRates}}, and \code{\link{DatasetSurvival}}
    for more than one comparison is created by adding subsequent digits to the variable names.
    The system can analyze these data in a multi-arm many-to-one comparison setting where the
    group with the highest index represents the control group.
}
Prefix \code{overall[Capital case of first letter of variable name]...} for the variable
names enables entering the overall (cumulative) results and calculates stage-wise statistics.
Since rpact version 3.2, the prefix \code{cumulative[Capital case of first letter of variable name]...} or 
\code{cum[Capital case of first letter of variable name]...} can alternatively be used for this. 

\code{n} can be used in place of \code{samplesizes}.

Note that in survival design usually the overall (cumulative) events and logrank test statistics are provided
in the output, so \cr
\code{getDataset(cumulativeEvents=, cumulativeLogRanks =, cumulativeAllocationRatios =)} \cr
is the usual command for entering survival data. Note also that for \code{cumulativeLogranks} also the
z scores from a Cox regression can be used.

For multi-arm designs, the index refers to the considered comparison. For example,\cr
\code{
  getDataset(events1=c(13, 33), logRanks1 = c(1.23, 1.55), events2 = c(16, NA), logRanks2 = c(1.55, NA))
} \cr
refers to the case where one active arm (1) is considered at both stages whereas active arm 2
was dropped at interim. Number of events and logrank statistics are entered for the corresponding
comparison to control (see Examples).

For enrichment designs, the comparison of two samples is provided for an unstratified
(sub-population wise) or stratified data input.\cr
For unstratified (sub-population wise) data input the data sets are defined for the sub-populations
S1, S2, ..., F, where F refers to the full populations. Use of \code{getDataset(S1 = , S2, ..., F = )}
defines the data set to be used in \code{\link{getAnalysisResults}} (see examples)\cr
For stratified data input the data sets are defined for the strata S1, S12, S2, ..., R, where R
refers to the remainder of the strata such that the union of all sets is the full population.
Use of \code{getDataset(S1 = , S12 = , S2, ..., R = )} defines the data set to be used in
\code{\link{getAnalysisResults}} (see examples)\cr
For survival data, for enrichment designs the log-rank statistics should be entered as stratified
log-rank statistics in order to provide strong control of Type I error rate. For stratified data input,
the variables to be specified in \code{getDataset()} are \code{events}, \code{expectedEvents},
\code{varianceEvents}, and \code{allocationRatios} or \code{overallEvents}, \code{overallExpectedEvents},
\code{overallVarianceEvents}, and \code{overallAllocationRatios}. From this, (stratified) log-rank tests are
calculated.
