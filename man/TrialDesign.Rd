\description{
Basic class for trial designs.
}
\details{
\code{TrialDesign} is the basic class for
\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{TrialDesignFisher}},
  \item \code{\link{TrialDesignGroupSequential}}, and
  \item \code{\link{TrialDesignInverseNormal}}.
}
}
\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{kMax}}{The maximum number of stages \code{K}.
Is a positive integer of length 1 (default value is \code{3}).
The maximum selectable \code{kMax} is \code{20} for group sequential or inverse normal and
\code{6} for Fisher combination test designs.}

\item{\code{alpha}}{The significance level alpha, default is `0.025`.
Is a positive numeric of length 1.}

\item{\code{stages}}{The stage numbers of the trial. Is an integer vector of length \code{kMax}.}

\item{\code{informationRates}}{The information rates (that must be fixed prior to the trial), 
default is \code{(1:kMax) / kMax}. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} (the maximum number of stages).}

\item{\code{userAlphaSpending}}{The user defined alpha spending. 
Numeric vector of length \code{kMax} containing the cumulative 
alpha-spending (Type I error rate) up to each interim stage: \code{0 <= alpha_1 <= ... <= alpha_K <= alpha}.}

\item{\code{criticalValues}}{The critical values for each stage of the trial. 
Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} (the maximum number of stages).}

\item{\code{stageLevels}}{The levels for each stage.}

\item{\code{alphaSpent}}{The cumulative alpha spent at each stage.
Is a numeric vector with length \code{kMax} (the maximum number of stages).}

\item{\code{bindingFutility}}{Logical. If \code{bindingFutility = TRUE} is specified the calculation of 
the critical values is affected by the futility bounds and the futility threshold is binding in the 
sense that the study must be stopped if the futility condition was reached (default is \code{FALSE}).}

\item{\code{tolerance}}{The numerical tolerance, default is \code{1e-06}. Is a positive numeric of length 1.}
