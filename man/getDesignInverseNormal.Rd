\arguments{
\item{...}{Ensures that all arguments (starting from the "...") are to be named and
that a warning will be displayed if unknown arguments are passed.}

\item{kMax}{The maximum number of stages \code{K}.
Must be a positive integer of length 1 (default value is \code{3}).
The maximum selectable \code{kMax} is \code{20} for group sequential or inverse normal and
\code{6} for Fisher combination test designs.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level alpha, default is \code{0.025}. Must be a positive numeric of length 1.}

\item{beta}{Type II error rate, necessary for providing sample size calculations
(e.g., \code{\link[=getSampleSizeMeans]{getSampleSizeMeans()}}), beta spending function designs,
or optimum designs, default is \code{0.20}. Must be a positive numeric of length 1.}

\item{sided}{Is the alternative one-sided (\code{1}) or two-sided (\code{2}), default is \code{1}.
Must be a positive integer of length 1.}

\item{informationRates}{The information rates t_1, ..., t_kMax (that must be fixed prior to the trial),
default is \code{(1:kMax) / kMax}. For the weighted inverse normal design, the weights are derived
through w_1 = sqrt(t_1), and w_k = sqrt(t_k - t_(k-1)). For the weighted Fisher's combination test, the
weights (scales) are w_k = sqrt((t_k - t_(k-1)) / t_1) (see the documentation).}

\item{futilityBounds}{The futility bounds, defined on the scale defined by \code{futilityBoundsScale}.
(numeric vector of length \code{kMax - 1}).}

\item{typeOfDesign}{The type of design. Type of design is one of the following:
O'Brien & Fleming (\code{"OF"}), Pocock (\code{"P"}), Wang & Tsiatis Delta class (\code{"WT"}),
Pampallona & Tsiatis (\code{"PT"}), Haybittle & Peto ("HP"),
Optimum design within Wang & Tsiatis class (\code{"WToptimum"}),
O'Brien & Fleming type alpha spending (\code{"asOF"}), Pocock type alpha spending (\code{"asP"}),
Kim & DeMets alpha spending (\code{"asKD"}), Hwang, Shi & DeCani alpha spending (\code{"asHSD"}),
user defined alpha spending (\code{"asUser"}), no early efficacy stop (\code{"noEarlyEfficacy"}),
default is \code{"OF"}.}

\item{deltaWT}{Delta for Wang & Tsiatis Delta class.}

\item{deltaPT1}{Delta1 for Pampallona & Tsiatis class rejecting H0 boundaries.}

\item{deltaPT0}{Delta0 for Pampallona & Tsiatis class rejecting H1 boundaries.}

\item{optimizationCriterion}{Optimization criterion for optimum design within
Wang & Tsiatis class (\code{"ASNH1"}, \code{"ASNIFH1"},
\code{"ASNsum"}), default is \code{"ASNH1"}, see details.}

\item{gammaA}{Parameter for alpha spending function.}

\item{typeBetaSpending}{Type of beta spending. Type of of beta spending is one of the following:
O'Brien & Fleming type beta spending, Pocock type beta spending,
Kim & DeMets beta spending, Hwang, Shi & DeCani beta spending, user defined
beta spending (\code{"bsOF"}, \code{"bsP"}, \code{"bsKD"},
\code{"bsHSD"}, \code{"bsUser"}, default is \code{"none"}).}

\item{userAlphaSpending}{The user defined alpha spending.
Numeric vector of length \code{kMax} containing the cumulative
alpha-spending (Type I error rate) up to each interim stage: \code{0 <= alpha_1 <= ... <= alpha_K <= alpha}.}

\item{userBetaSpending}{The user defined beta spending. Vector of length \code{kMax} containing the cumulative
beta-spending up to each interim stage.}

\item{efficacyStops}{Logical vector of length \code{kMax - 1} indicating efficacy stops. Default is \code{NA}.}

\item{futilityStops}{Logical vector of length \code{kMax - 1} indicating futility stops. Default is \code{NA}.}

\item{gammaB}{Parameter for beta spending function.}

\item{bindingFutility}{Logical. If \code{bindingFutility = TRUE} is specified the calculation of
the critical values is affected by the futility bounds and the futility threshold is binding in the
sense that the study must be stopped if the futility condition was reached (default is \code{FALSE}).}

\item{futilityBoundsScale}{Character. The scale of the futility bounds.
Must be one of \code{"zValue"}, \code{"pValue"}, or \code{"reverseCondPower"}.
Default is \code{"zValue"}.}

\item{directionUpper}{Logical. Specifies the direction of the alternative,
only applicable for one-sided testing; default is \code{TRUE}
which means that larger values of the test statistics yield smaller p-values.}

\item{betaAdjustment}{For two-sided beta spending designs, if \code{betaAdjustement = TRUE} a linear
adjustment of the beta spending values is performed if an overlapping of decision regions for futility
stopping at earlier stages occurs, otherwise no adjustment is performed (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{constantBoundsHP}{The constant bounds up to stage \code{kMax - 1} for the
Haybittle & Peto design (default is \code{3}).}

\item{twoSidedPower}{For two-sided testing, if \code{twoSidedPower = TRUE} is specified
the sample size calculation is performed by considering both tails of the distribution.
Default is \code{FALSE}, i.e., it is assumed that one tail probability is equal to 0 or the power
should be directed to one part.}

\item{tolerance}{The numerical tolerance, default is \code{1e-08}.}

\value{
Returns a \code{\link{TrialDesign}} object.
The following generics (R generic functions) are available for this result object:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=names.FieldSet]{names()}} to obtain the field names,
\item \code{\link[=print.FieldSet]{print()}} to print the object,
\item \code{\link[=summary.ParameterSet]{summary()}} to display a summary of the object,
\item \code{\link[=plot.TrialDesign]{plot()}} to plot the object,
\item \code{\link[=as.data.frame.TrialDesign]{as.data.frame()}} to coerce the object to a \code{\link[base]{data.frame}},
\item \code{\link[=as.matrix.FieldSet]{as.matrix()}} to coerce the object to a \code{\link[base]{matrix}}.
}
}
\description{
Provides adjusted boundaries and defines a group sequential design for its use in
the inverse normal combination test.
}
\details{
Depending on \code{typeOfDesign} some parameters are specified, others not.
For example, only if \code{typeOfDesign} \code{"asHSD"} is selected, \code{gammaA} needs to be specified.

If an alpha spending approach was specified (\code{"asOF"}, \code{"asP"}, \code{"asKD"}, \code{"asHSD"}, or \code{"asUser"})
additionally a beta spending function can be specified to produce futility bounds.

For optimum designs, \code{"ASNH1"} minimizes the expected sample size under H1,
\code{"ASNIFH1"} minimizes the sum of the maximum sample and the expected sample size under H1,
and \code{"ASNsum"}  minimizes the sum of the maximum sample size, the expected sample size under a value midway H0 and H1,
and the expected sample size under H1.

Click on the link of a generic in the list above to go directly to the help documentation of
the \code{rpact} specific implementation of the generic.
Note that you can use the R function \code{\link[utils]{methods}} to get all the methods of a generic and
to identify the object specific name of it, e.g.,
use \code{methods("plot")} to get all the methods for the \code{plot} generic.
There you can find, e.g., \code{plot.AnalysisResults} and
obtain the specific help documentation linked above by typing \code{?plot.AnalysisResults}.
